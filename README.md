# Airbnb Price Prediction and Insights
Airbnb Price Prediction and Insights Using Machine Learning
#  Overview
Airbnb provides a platform for property owners to rent out their spaces to travelers. Pricing a listing effectively is critical for maximizing revenue while staying competitive in the market. For hosts, understanding what factors influence the price of their listings is essential. This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the price of Airbnb listingsbased on various features such as property type, room type, location, amenities, and host characteristics. By analyzing these factors, this project will provide actionable insights to Airbnb hosts to optimize their listing prices.
# Problem Statement
The primary objective of this project is to develop a regression model that predicts the price of an Airbnb listing. Using features such as property type, room type, number of reviews, location, and amenities, the model will aim to estimate the price accurately. The insights derived from this analysis will help Airbnb hosts understand the key drivers of price, enabling them to make data-driven decisions for pricing their properties. Additionally, the project will help Airbnb refine its recommendations for pricing to improve host and guest satisfaction.
